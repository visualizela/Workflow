The digitization process is simple but at USC the scanner is only so powerful and an email can only be sent with so much information that it is impossible to scan an entire binder of 20 - 45 pages in one go. You must do this in parts or it will not work.
Before digitization is to occur, create a folder within the drive that is strictly related to the digitized content and then create another folder within that folder to hold specifically placed digitized materials.

For this section and onwards I will be writing within the lens of digitizing the South Los Angeles Plans, which was a single binder within the group. The folder within the folder was named South LA Plans.

Because the text within this binder was split into three groups I created three folders within the South LA Plans folder labeled Intro, Community Plan, Specific Plan after the headings within the text. From this point you are ready to digitize.

Within the VKC there is a AltaLink C8035 scanner/printer that is located behind the front desk.
Turn this on with the power button.
When the device has been turned on look at the touch screen interface and there should be an image of a letter with the words Email underneath it.
Click/touch this icon and on the next page touch add recipient.
Put in email address (if using graduate school email like email@g.ucla put in the g otherwise the transfer of files will take longer) and click ok.
Scroll down on the email file page and there will be a tab that says Resolution. Click/touch this tab and it will give you options ranging from 72 dpi to 600 dpi, choose 600 dpi.
Scroll down further and at the bottom before the reset button there will be a tab that says “Build Job.” Click/touch this tab and make sure that it has a checkmark next to it. This indicates that you will be scanning multiple pages that are to be sent to your email instead of just one.
On the top right of the screen there will be a button that states “Scan” click/touch this button and begin to scan each of your documents.
Scan no more than 8 documents during a session if you wish to have no issues with the transfer.
Once this is completed you can send the files to your email.

Place the files into the correct folders corresponding to their location within the text, they will be renamed after the next step.

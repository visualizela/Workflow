After the digitization and organization is complete we move onto the next step with is creating a master spreadsheet, this spreadsheet is for the individual pages within the binders rather than the binders themselves.

Create another spreadsheet labeled LA Planning 1991 Master (or whatever your collections name is) and label nine columns from A to I. It should be in this order:

**ID    Title    Title on Google Drive    Folder on Google Drive    Map Included (Y/N)    Page Number    Date(s) Included?    Basic Description    Extra Documentation**

*ID* refers to the unique ID that each page will have. The ID is created by the user (for our case we used planning_00001, planning_00002, etc. to refer to each individual document.

*Title* refers to the tile that is provided on the page that you are documenting. If there is no title write “No Title.” The pages that are parts of a larger map all have titles that are six numbers and the letter P in the middle. If the title isn’t apparent/easy to discern e.g. not bolded, separate from the rest of the text, etc. then just write “No Title.”

*Title on Google Drive* refers to what you saved the file as when you placed it into Google Drive. Because the files will be changed to reflect their ID number later this step is only for the sake of lessening confusion on the transfer in tandem with the page number.

*Folder on Google Drive* refers to what folder the file has been placed within the South LA Plans folder.

*Map Included (Y/N)* Indicates whether or not there is a map on the page.

*Page Number* indicates the page number both counted by the documenter as well as transcribed from the pages. There are some pages within the text at indicate alternate page numbers such as SC - 1. For this the page number will be written as documenters number (written number) e.g. 8 (SC-2).

*Date(s) Included?* This indicates if there are any dates within the documentation, generally alternate dates can be found on the “Amendments Date Log” page or the ordinance plan title page as that includes effective dates of the documentation. If there are no dates write None.

*Basic Description* includes the basic description of what is on the page. This includes names involved, section headers, area of map, etc.

*Extra Documentation* includes extraneous details that while not covered in the description could be considered important for finding certain information within the text. This can be asterixis indicating information, indications of continuation from previous pages, etc. This isn’t a necessary point of inclusion so if there isn’t additional information that the documenter views as important this column can be left blank for certain rows such as with the maps.

Once this is finished your spreadsheet should look like this:

Once all of this information is put into the spreadsheet you are going to go through and check the accuracy between the files and the spreadsheet. Once this is concluded change the names of the files within the drive to fit their respective ID’s.

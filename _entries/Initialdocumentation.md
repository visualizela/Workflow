The purpose of this step for the project is to collect physical data (the binders of government documents) onto a single spreadsheet (Google sheets was used for this job) for easy accessibility of materials. This allows those who wish to find specific files to locate them without the requirement of going through each individual binder for the sake of material access.
Note: For this project (1991 Los Angeles City Planning Documents) this step has been completed, however for future projects that are similar, following this template would help to generate a standard for USC’s documents that are to be digitized within the VKC library.

Open up a google spreadsheet and at the top of the columns write the following in order so that it looks like below: 

**In Catalog        Name        Call #        Date        #Maps Included        Content/Notes**

It should be six columns from A to F.

*In Catalog* refers to whether or not the file can be located within USC’s digital catalog through a search. This is a step done after all of the materials have been documented within the spreadsheet. Write “Yes” if the file can be found online and “No” if it can’t. If you find the file but it is under a different name, call number, or finding it required a different search than the others, indicate this through parentheses next to the initial answer e.g. “Yes (under different call number)”
You can search the USC library catalog for the binders using [this link](https://libraries.usc.edu/).

*Name* refers to the name of the document as referenced on the title sheet within the binder or the name printed on the side of the binder. Generally these two names are the same but if there is no name on the side of the binder than use the name on the title sheet within. If no name is indicated anywhere write down “No Name Included”. Make sure that the punctuation is transcribed correctly e.g. if the counties are separated by a / or by a , then you need to include this. Capitalization of names isn’t required beyond the first letter.

*Call #* refers to the call number on the side of the binder (for this group of files it was HT 169.73.L7 L(group of numbers). This number can also be seen often within the binder on a sticker, usually on the front page. The two numbers are generally the same, however if there are two differing numbers then write both of them down and check with the online catalog later to confirm the correct number.

*Date* refers to the date printed on the call number sticker. Alternate dates within the text can be noted within the Content/Notes section though this isn’t necessary given that government documents tend to include a number of varying dates due to when ordinances are passed. If a date isn’t included on the call number sticker put in N/A.

*#Maps Included* refers to the number of maps within binder. There are some restrictions for certain maps. 
Small, unusable pictures of maps such as the ones that are frequently utilized on the title page are not counted as they have no text data (keys, street names, etc.) that can be used beyond aesthetic purposes. 
Pages that have multiple small maps within them: Count each individual map.
Large color map that is loose (generally located near the end of the binder): Count as one map
The multiple pages that correspond to the larger color map at the end: Count as one single map
Multiple pages of black and white maps: Count individually due to differences in text on map (unless they correspond to a larger map that can be pulled out in which case count as one map)
Other map like images such as building schematics: Count as individual maps (it is up to whomever is documenting if they want to make a note of this).

*Content/Notes* refers to whatever extraneous information the person who is documenting the content wishes to put in for the sake of distinguishing the information within the binders even more. This can include a lack of materials compared to the other binders, repeated binders with additional information, anomalies within the documentation, etc. 

Once this is finished your spreadsheet should look like this:
<img src="img/Inventory.png" width="500" height="500">

These binders have similar structures and often have similar materials within them so be careful to distinguish them through documentation.
Additional details: Include binders that have nothing within them but still maintain documentation through the form of Call # stickers on the side.

Once all of the documents have been written into the spreadsheet and the information has been placed in the correct places move on to the digitization of the materials.
